<h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
Artificial Intelligence suggest that machines can mimic humans in:

Talking
Thinking
Learning
Planning
Understanding
Artificial Intelligence is also called Machine Intelligence and Computer Intelligence.

Arthur Samuel 1959:
"Machine Learning is a subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed"

Arthur Samuel, IBM Journal of Research and Development, Vol. 3, 1959.

Wikipedia 2022:
Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines. Unlike natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality.

Investopedia 2022:
Artificial intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.

IBM 2022:
Artificial intelligence leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind.

Britannica 2022:
Artificial intelligence is the ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings, .... such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past experience.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)
Artificial Intelligence is a scientific discipline embracing several Data Science fields ranging from narrow AI to strong AI, including machine learning, deep learning, big data and data mining.

Artificial Intelligence
Narrow AI
Machine Learning
Neural Networks
Big Data
Deep Learning
Strong AI
Narrow AI
Narrow Artificial Intelligence is limited to narrow (specific) areas like most of the AI we have around us today:

Email spam Filters
Text to Speech
Speech Recognition
Self Driving Cars
E-Payment
Google Maps
Text Autocorrect
Automated Translation
Chatbots
Social Media
Face Detection
Visual Perception
Search Algorithms
Robots
Automated Investment
NLP - Natural Language Processing
Flying Drones
IBM's Dr. Watson
Apple's Siri
Microsoft's Cortana
Amazon's Alexa
Netflix's Recommendations
Narrow AI is also called Weak AI.

Weak AI: Built to simulate human intelligence.

Strong AI: Built to copy human intelligence.
